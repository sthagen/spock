== JUnit 4 Module

Integration with JUnit 4 features for Spock 2+ (which internally uses JUnit Platform - part of JUnit 5).

The module is required for:

 - running JUnit 4 rules and class ruless (`@Rule`/`@ClassRule`)
 - using JUnit 4's test fixture annotations (`@BeforeClass`, `@Before`, `@After`, `@AfterClass`)

NOTE: This module does its best to support old features from JUnit 4, however, users are encouraged to migrate to the native Spock counterparts.


== Guice Module

Integration with the http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/[Guice] IoC container. For examples see the specs in the
https://github.com/spockframework/spock/tree/master/spock-guice/src/test/groovy/org/spockframework/guice[codebase].

With Spock 1.2+ detached mocks are automatically attached to the `Specification` if they are injected via `@Inject`.
